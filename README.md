# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project, we are interested in analyzing ride-sharing data. Specifically, we want to group the data by city type, such as urban, rural, and suburban. Then, we want to know the total number of ride-share drivers there are for each city type. As well as the total number of rides, total amount of fares, and the average fare per ride and average fare per driver in these city types. Then, we will compare the city types. Additionally, we are interested in visualizing the total fare amounts for each week of the first four months of 2019. This will also be compared for each city type.

## Results

The following image shows the summary of the ride-sharing data for each city type. Below this image, the results will be discussed.

### Rides per City Type

There were 2,375 total rides for all cities. The vast majority of those rides were in urban cities. In fact, suburban and rural cities only made up 31.6% of all rides combined. 

### Drivers per City Type

In total, there are 2,973 drivers in the data analyzed. More than 80% of all drivers are in urban cities. This is disproportionately higher than we would expect as urban cities have more than 80% of the drivers and less than 70% of the rides.

### Fares per City Type

For all cities, the total amount of fares analyzed in this data is $63,538.64. That means that 62.7% of the total cost for these rides were in urban cities. One reason that these fares are lower than we would expect for urban cities could be because the distance traveled on each ride is shorter than the other city types.

### Average Fares

The average fare per ride in each city type shows an interesting result. Rural cities actually have a higher average fare per ride than both the suburban and urban city types. In addition to that, the average fare per driver is significantly higher from rural cities to urban cities. In fact, rural drivers make over three times as much money on the average ride than urban drivers do. Again, this may be due to the fact that rural rides may cover a farther distance and take more time, therefore, the fare is higher.

### Weekly Fares per City Type

The following line chart shows the total fares by week for the first four months of 2019.

As we can see, urban cities always have a higher fare total than suburban cities which always have a higher fare total than rural cities. Also, we can see that several times throughout this line chart, when one line spikes upward, or dips downward, they all tend to follow the same trend. This indicates that when more people ride through PyBer in urban cities, they also ride more in suburban and rural cities and vice-versa. 

## Summary

Based on this data, there are three recommendations for how to reduce the disparities between city types.

### Three Recommendations

The first recommendation is to increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities. Although the total amount of rides and fares is lowest in rural cities, they have the highest average fares per ride and per driver. A plausible reason the number of rides and fares is so low is due to the lack of drivers who can give rides to those who want them.

The second recommendation is to decrease the number of drivers in urban cities. There are currently 780 more drivers than there were rides. This shows a surplus of drivers that are cutting down the average fare per driver. Therefore, it is not very profitable to be a PyBer driver in the city because of the abundance of drivers taking customers and leaving other drivers with limited rides available. These drivers could relocate to the rural or suburban areas.

The third and final recommendation is to lower the fares for both rural and suburban cities. Suburban cities had about 48.6% of the total fares than urban cities, but suburban cities have only 20% of the drivers and 38% of the rides. It is safe to say that suburban cities are outperforming urban cities in every aspect. If fares were reduced in suburban and rural cities, more people may choose to use PyBer and therefore, increase demand. Once this demand is increased, more urban drivers will go to the suburbs or rural areas to pick up these rides to earn more money. Then, all three city types will be profitable with those cities with the highest average fares having more riders.
